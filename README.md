# CSE584_Project1
README
This project involves developing a classifier to distinguish between text completions generated by three distinct Large Language Models (LLMs): GPT-4, Llama 3 (Meta AI), and Gemini 1.5 Pro. The classifier is trained on a dataset comprising 2,370 data points, each labeled according to the LLM that generated the completion. The goal is to correctly predict which LLM completed a given truncated sentence based on their unique text generation patterns.

Participant: Xinzhang Xiong

Dataset:
The dataset (20240928project1_data2) includes:

First Column: Labels (1=GPT-4, 2=Llama 3, 3=Gemini 1.5 Pro)
Second Column: Completed sentences by the corresponding LLM
The data was generated by prompting the LLMs with: "I want you to finish each sentence with at least 20 words. Please make them complete sentences and unique with each other. Please keep the order as given."

System requirement: python==3.11.9. See requirement file
